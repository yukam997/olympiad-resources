  <h1>Hi</h1>
  <p>
  This website is to help organizations, countries, as well as individuals who are starting off with Math Olympiads. It's hard to bridge the gap between math from highschool, and the math experiences you need to be able to solve probles in olympiads.
  The main hope of this site is to share resources as well as experiences others have had, so that organizations hoping to train the next generation of math olympiad students, as well as students who want to learn about olympiads know what resouces to look and help them better study for this.
